# 📝 MERN Blog App

This is a full-stack **Blog Application** built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).  
I made this project as part of my journey to learn **backend development**, REST APIs, and connecting them to a frontend.  
It supports features like user registration/login, creating, updating, and deleting blogs.
